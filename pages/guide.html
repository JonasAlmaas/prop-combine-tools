                        Static Prop combine, or as more often refered to as "Autocombine" is a CS:GO exclusive
                        feature that came along with the 2015 version of Nuke.
                    </p>
                    <p class="textbox">
                        It allows VBSP to combine multiple static props into one big prop. The rules it follows
                        to do so can either be automatically made when compiling or manually defined in any text
                        editor or by using this program.

                                CS:GO players expect extremely high fps on all maps and autocombine can help you
                                with just that. The way the Source Engine works is that it creates a draw call
                                per material one for each mesh using said material. By combining meshes together
                                that are sharing materials you can greatly reduce the amounts of total draw calls.
                            </p>
                            <p class="textbox">
                                Too many draw calls is often the reason for lag
                                on maps. It's way better to draw a bit of extra geometry than to have a lot of draw calls.
                                Valve stated that after implementing autocombine on Nuke the map ran 40% faster.
                            </p>
                            <p class="textbox">
                                As an example, the kegs on the side here are all using the same material, in other words, by
                                combining them into one prop you will reduce the draw calls from seven down to just two.

                    <p class="textbox">
                        The number one factor to make autocombine work is having the source files for the model.
                        If you are trying to use any valve made model you will have to decompile them using a tool like
                        <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="link" id="link-crowbar">Crowbar</a>, you will also have to
                        rename them before compiling to prevent overlapping model names.
                    </p>
                    <p class="textbox">
                        It's very important that the .qc, the reference mesh(supported formats are: .smd, .dmx and .fbx) and the physics
                        mesh are all located in <a class="highlighted">"...\Steam\steamapps\common\content\csgo\models\"</a>. It's also very
                        important that the correct folder structure is used. If your model path is
                        <a class="highlighted">"bavaria\keg_01"</a> you have to make sure the files are located in
                        <a class="highlighted">"...\Steam\steamapps\common\content\csgo\models\bavaria\"</a>. This is also the location
                        you have to compile the model from.

                            If you are using Blender I would recomend getting the addon <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="link" id="link-sourceOps">SourceOps</a>.
                            It can help you with many Source Engine related things, one of them being autocombine.
                            By checking "Static Prop Combine" in the model options <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="link" id="link-sourceOps">SourceOps</a>
                            automatically places and compiles the model in the correct locatioin, so that you don't have to worry about that.

                        Once all of that is set up you can start using this program. The first thing you want to do is to go in to
                        <a href="./games.html" class="link" >Games</a>, there you can create game profiles.The path should point to
                        the root folder of your project.

                        After that you can create your first <a href="./projects.html" class="link" >project</a>. Configuring a project
                        should be relativly easy. Just creat clusters and fill in the requiered values.

                        When loading up the game the props shouldn't look any different, do how do you know if it worked?
                        There are many ways to confirm this, one way is to open the .bps with a tool like
                        <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="link" id="link-vide">VIDE</a>, when compiling it automatically packs the autocombined
                        models into the .bsp, if they are here it worked. Look for _autocombine.

                        Another way to check if it is working is to use the compile parameter <a class="highlighted">-StaticPropCombine_ColorInstances</a>,
                        this gives the combined prop a colour tint, so if there are all the same colour, it worked. Colour tints dont work in fullbright
                        so you will have to compile lighting to see it.
